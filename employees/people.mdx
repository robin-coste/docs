## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Keep Directory Updated" icon="sync">
    Regular sync ensures accurate employee data. Stale data leads to security gaps.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use Meaningful Groups" icon="layer-group">
    Create groups that align with how you manage security. Department-based is common.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Close Tasks Promptly" icon="check">
    Unactioned access tasks are security risks. Set SLAs and monitor completion.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Audit Regularly" icon="clipboard-list">
