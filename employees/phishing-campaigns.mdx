## Overview

Phishing Campaigns let you test employee security awareness with realistic phishing simulations. Measure vulnerability, identify training needs, and track improvement over time.

## Why Phishing Simulations?

### The Threat

- **91%** of cyberattacks start with phishing
- **Average cost** of a phishing breach: $4.65M
- **Click rates** range from 5-30% even in trained organizations

### Benefits of Simulation

- Measure actual employee behavior
- Identify high-risk individuals and departments
- Reinforce training with practical experience
- Track improvement over time
- Meet compliance requirements

## Creating a Campaign

### Campaign Setup

1. Navigate to **Employees** → **Phishing Campaigns**
2. Click **Create Campaign**
3. Configure basics:
   - Campaign name

## Campaign Monitoring

### Real-Time Dashboard

Monitor campaign progress:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Sent** | Emails delivered |
| **Opened** | Email opened (if tracking enabled) |
| **Clicked** | Link clicked |
| **Submitted** | Data entered on landing page |
| **Reported** | Reported as phishing |

### Event Timeline

View individual employee actions:

1. Email delivered (timestamp)
2. Email opened (timestamp)
3. Link clicked (timestamp)
4. Form submitted (timestamp)
5. Reported as suspicious (timestamp)

## Analytics and Reporting

### Campaign Results

| Metric | Calculation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Click Rate** | Clicked / Sent × 100 |
| **Submission Rate** | Submitted / Sent × 100 |
| **Report Rate** | Reported / Sent × 100 |
| **Compromise Rate** | Submitted / Clicked × 100 |

### Comparisons

Compare results:

- Against previous campaigns
- By department
- By seniority level
- Industry benchmarks

### Trend Analysis

Track improvement over time:

- Monthly click rate trends
- Department improvement
- Training impact correlation

## Reporting Mechanism

### Employee Reporting

Enable employees to report suspicious emails:

- **Outlook Add-in** - Report button in Outlook
- **Gmail Add-on** - Report in Gmail
- **Forward to Address** - Forward to security team

### Report Handling

When employees report:

1. Email analyzed (real threat or simulation)
2. If simulation: marked as "Reported" in campaign
3. If real threat: escalated to security team
4. Employee receives feedback

## Remediation

### Training Assignment

Auto-assign training when employees fail:

1. Enable auto-remediation in campaign settings
2. Select training course to assign
3. Set assignment timing (immediately, after campaign)
4. Configure notifications

### Just-in-Time Training

Immediately after clicking:

1. Employee redirected to educational page
2. Shows what they missed (phishing indicators)
3. Short training module on the spot
4. Tracks completion

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start Easy, Progress Harder" icon="signal">
    Begin with obvious phishing. Gradually increase difficulty as awareness improves.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Test Regularly" icon="calendar">
    Monthly or quarterly campaigns maintain awareness. Annual testing isn't enough.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Vary Templates" icon="shuffle">
    Use different scenarios each campaign. Employees learn to spot specific patterns otherwise.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Focus on Education" icon="graduation-cap">
    Goal is learning, not punishment. Use failures as teaching moments.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Celebrate Reporting" icon="trophy">
    Recognize employees who report phishing. Build a culture of reporting.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Compliance

Phishing simulations support:

| Framework | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| **SOC 2** | CC2.2, CC9.2 |
| **ISO 27001** | A.7.2.2 |
| **PCI DSS** | 12.6.3.1 |
| **NIST CSF** | PR.AT-1 |
