## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Keep Training Short" icon="clock">
    Micro-learning is more effective. 10-15 minute modules have higher completion rates.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Make It Relevant" icon="bullseye">
    Tailor training to job roles. Finance should learn about invoice fraud; IT about system security.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Train Continuously" icon="rotate">
    Annual training isn't enough. Regular micro-training maintains awareness year-round.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Follow Up on Failures" icon="graduation-cap">
    Phishing failures should trigger additional training, not just penalties.
