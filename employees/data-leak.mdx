title: Data Leak Monitoring
description: 'Monitor for employee credential breaches and data exposures'
---

## Overview

Data Leak Monitoring scans for your employees' credentials in data breaches across the dark web and public breach databases. Identify compromised accounts before attackers exploit them.

## Why Data Leak Monitoring?

### The Risk

- **Average person** has 100+ online accounts
- **65%** of people reuse passwords
- **Billions** of credentials exposed in breaches
- **Compromised credentials** are sold and traded

### Credential Reuse Impact

When an employee's personal account is breached:

1. Attackers try the same password elsewhere
2. Corporate accounts often share passwords
3. Credential stuffing attacks are automated
4. Accounts compromised within hours

## How It Works

### Monitoring Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Domain Configuration">
    Bastion monitors your email domains.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Breach Scanning">
    Continuous scanning of breach databases and dark web.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Match Detection">
    Employee emails matched against breach data.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Alert Generation">
    Alerts created for exposed credentials.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Remediation">
    Password reset and employee notification.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Data Sources

| Source | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Breach Databases** | Collections of known breaches |

- Status (new, in progress, resolved)

### Issue Severity

| Severity | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| **Critical** | Plaintext password exposed |
| **High** | Weak hash exposed (likely cracked) |
| **Medium** | Strong hash exposed |
| **Low** | Email only, no password |

### Issue Details

Click an issue to see:

- **Breach Information** - Name, date, scope
- **Exposed Data** - What was leaked
- **Employee History** - Past breaches for this employee
- **Recommended Actions** - Remediation steps

## Remediation Workflow

2. Automatic forced password reset triggered
3. Employee must reset on next login
4. Reset verified in Bastion

### Supported Integrations

- Azure Active Directory
- Okta
- Google Workspace

## Historical Data

### Breach History

View historical breach data:

- Total breaches affecting organization
- Trend over time
- Most affected employees
- Common breach sources

### Employee Breach History

Per employee:

- Credential hygiene education

## Reporting

### Breach Reports

Generate reports showing:

- **Summary** - Total breaches, affected employees
- **Trend** - Breaches over time
- **By Department** - Department breakdown
- **Remediation Status** - Open vs. resolved

### Compliance Evidence

Breach monitoring supports:

| Framework | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| **SOC 2** | CC6.8 |
| **ISO 27001** | A.12.6.1 |
| **PCI DSS** | 12.10 |

### Escalation

Set up escalation for unresolved issues:

1. Initial alert to security team
2. 24 hours: reminder to security team
3. 48 hours: escalate to manager
4. 72 hours: escalate to CISO
