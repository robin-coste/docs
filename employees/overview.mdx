## Why Employee Security?

### The Human Factor

- **95%** of security breaches involve human error
- **Phishing** remains the top attack vector
- **Credential reuse** leads to account compromise
- **Insider threats** are often unintentional

### Building Security Culture

Bastion helps you:

- Train employees on security best practices
- Test awareness with realistic simulations
- Monitor for compromised credentials
- Track security compliance by employee

## Module Components

### People

Centralized employee management:

- **User Directory** - All employees in one place
- **Compliance Groups** - Organize by department, role, or risk
- **Tasks** - Access management and onboarding tasks
- **Import** - Sync from identity providers

### Awareness Training

Security education programs:

- **Training Courses** - Interactive security modules
- **Assignment** - Assign by group or individual
- **Progress Tracking** - Monitor completion rates
- **Reminders** - Automated follow-up for incomplete training

### Phishing Campaigns

Test employee awareness:

- **Campaign Creation** - Build phishing simulations
- **Templates** - Realistic phishing scenarios
- **Targeting** - Select audiences by group
- **Analytics** - Click rates, report rates, trends

### Data Leak Monitoring

Monitor for credential breaches:

- **Breach Detection** - Identify compromised credentials
- **Alert System** - Notify affected employees
- **Remediation** - Password reset workflows
- **Reporting** - Breach history and trends

## Security Metrics

### Employee Security Score

Track individual employee security:

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Training Completion | Positive |
| Phishing Success | Negative |
| Credential Breaches | Negative |
| Reporting Phishing | Positive |

### Organizational Metrics

Monitor overall security culture:

- **Training Completion Rate** - % of employees trained
- **Phishing Click Rate** - % clicking simulated phishing
- **Report Rate** - % reporting suspicious emails
- **Breach Count** - Employees with leaked credentials

## Integration Points

### Identity Providers

Sync employees from:

- Azure Active Directory
- Okta
- Google Workspace

### Email Systems

Send phishing simulations via:

- Microsoft 365
- Google Workspace

### ITSM

Create tickets for:

- Password resets
- Access provisioning
- Security incidents

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Train Before Testing" icon="graduation-cap">
    Deploy training before phishing campaigns. Testing untrained employees is counterproductive.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use Realistic Simulations" icon="mask">
    Phishing templates should reflect real-world threats your employees might encounter.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Focus on Education, Not Punishment" icon="heart">
    Phishing failures should trigger additional training, not disciplinary action.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Continuous Program" icon="rotate">
    Security awareness is ongoing. Regular training and testing maintain awareness.
