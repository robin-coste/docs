## Overview

Device Vulnerabilities provides continuous vulnerability scanning across your device fleet. Identify CVEs, prioritize remediation, and track patching progress.

## How Scanning Works

### Scan Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Software Inventory">
    Agent collects installed software and versions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="CVE Matching">
    Software matched against vulnerability databases.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Risk Scoring">
    Vulnerabilities scored by severity and exploitability.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reporting">
    Results displayed in dashboard with remediation guidance.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Data Sources

| Source | Coverage |
|--------|----------|
| **NVD** | National Vulnerability Database |
| **CVE** | Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures |
| **Vendor Advisories** | Microsoft, Apple, Linux distros |
| **Exploit DB** | Known exploits |

## Vulnerability Dashboard

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Total Vulnerabilities** | Unique CVEs across fleet |
| **Affected Devices** | Devices with vulnerabilities |
| **Critical/High** | High-severity issues |
| **Exploitable** | Known exploit available |

### Vulnerability List

View all vulnerabilities:

- CVE ID and description
- Severity (CVSS score)
- Affected software
- Device count
- Remediation status

## Severity Scoring

### CVSS Scores

| Score | Severity | Priority |
|-------|----------|----------|
| 9.0-10.0 | Critical | Immediate |
| 7.0-8.9 | High | Within 48 hours |
| 4.0-6.9 | Medium | Within 2 weeks |
| 0.1-3.9 | Low | Scheduled patching |

### Additional Factors

Beyond CVSS, consider:

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Known Exploit** | Increases priority |
| **Internet Facing** | Higher risk |
| **Critical System** | Higher priority |
| **Compensating Controls** | May reduce priority |

## Viewing Vulnerabilities

### By Vulnerability

See all devices affected by a specific CVE:

1. Click on vulnerability
2. View affected devices
3. See software versions
4. Access remediation guidance

### By Device

See all vulnerabilities on a specific device:

1. Go to **Devices** → **Device List**
2. Select device
3. Go to **Vulnerabilities** tab
4. View all CVEs for that device

### By Software

See all vulnerabilities for a software package:

1. Go to **Vulnerabilities** → **Software**
2. Select software
3. View CVE history
4. See affected versions

## Remediation

### Remediation Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Patch** | Update to fixed version |
| **Upgrade** | Move to new major version |
| **Remove** | Uninstall vulnerable software |
| **Mitigate** | Apply compensating controls |
| **Accept** | Document risk acceptance |

### Remediation Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Assess">
    Review vulnerability details and impact.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Plan">
    Determine remediation approach.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test">
    Test patch/update in non-production.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy">
    Roll out remediation to affected devices.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify">
    Confirm vulnerability is resolved.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Tracking Progress

Track remediation status:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Open** | Not addressed |
| **In Progress** | Being remediated |
| **Resolved** | Successfully remediated |
| **Accepted** | Risk accepted |

## Automation

### Auto-Patching

Enable automatic patching for:

- Operating system updates
- Browser updates
- Common applications
- Security patches

### Patch Windows

Configure maintenance windows:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Patch Windows**
2. Define allowed update times
3. Set restart policies
4. Configure user notifications

## Exclusions

### Excluding Vulnerabilities

When a vulnerability doesn't apply:

1. Select vulnerability
2. Click **Exclude**
3. Choose exclusion type:
   - Global (all devices)
   - Device-specific
   - Temporary (with expiration)
4. Document reason

### Exclusion Management

Review and manage exclusions:

- List all exclusions
- Expiration dates
- Justifications
- Re-enable as needed

## Reporting

### Vulnerability Reports

Generate reports showing:

- **Summary** - Overview of vulnerability status
- **Trend** - Changes over time
- **By Software** - Most vulnerable applications
- **By Device** - Devices needing attention
- **SLA** - Time to remediation metrics

### Compliance Evidence

Vulnerability management provides evidence for:

| Framework | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| **SOC 2** | CC7.1 |
| **ISO 27001** | A.12.6.1 |
| **PCI DSS** | 6.1, 6.2 |
| **HIPAA** | §164.308(a)(5) |

## Alerts

### Alert Configuration

Set up alerts for:

| Alert Type | Trigger |
|------------|---------|
| **New Critical** | Critical CVE discovered |
| **Exploit Available** | Exploit published for CVE |
| **SLA Breach** | Vulnerability exceeds SLA |
| **Regression** | Previously fixed, now present |

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Prioritize Ruthlessly" icon="sort">
    Focus on critical/high with known exploits first. Don't try to fix everything at once.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Maintain Patch Cadence" icon="calendar">
    Regular patching prevents vulnerability buildup. Monthly at minimum.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Test Before Deploying" icon="flask">
    Patches can break things. Test in non-production first.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Track SLAs" icon="clock">
    Set and track remediation SLAs. Critical within 48 hours, High within 2 weeks.
  </Accordion>
