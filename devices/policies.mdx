## Overview

Device Policies let you define and enforce security configurations across your device fleet. Create policies for different device groups and monitor compliance.

## Policy Types

### Configuration Profiles

| Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Security Baseline** | Core security settings |
| **Password Policy** | Password requirements |
| **Encryption** | Disk encryption requirements |
| **Firewall** | Firewall configuration |
| **Software Restrictions** | Allowed/blocked applications |
| **Network** | VPN, WiFi, proxy settings |

### Compliance Policies

Define what makes a device compliant:

- Operating system version
- Encryption enabled
- Antivirus installed
- Latest patches applied
- No prohibited software

## Creating Policies

### Policy Wizard

1. Navigate to **Devices** → **Policies**
2. Click **Create Policy**
3. Select policy type
4. Configure settings
5. Define scope (device groups)
6. Review and save

### Policy Settings

Each policy type has specific settings:

**Password Policy Example:**

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Minimum Length | 12 characters |
| Require Complexity | Yes |
| Maximum Age | 90 days |
| History | Last 5 passwords |
| Lockout Threshold | 5 attempts |

**Encryption Policy Example:**

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Require Encryption | Yes |
| Algorithm | AES-256 |
| Recovery Key | Escrow to Bastion |
| Grace Period | 7 days |

## Policy Assignment

### Assignment Methods

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **By Group** | Apply to device group |
| **By OS** | Apply to OS type |
| **By User** | Apply to user's devices |
| **All Devices** | Global policy |

### Assignment Priority

When multiple policies apply:

1. Device-specific (highest priority)
2. Group policies
3. OS policies
4. Global policies (lowest priority)

### Conflicts

When settings conflict:

- More restrictive setting wins
- Manual override available
- Conflicts flagged in dashboard

## Deployment

### Deployment Modes

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| **Enforce** | Settings applied automatically |
| **Monitor** | Check compliance, don't enforce |
| **Report** | Log only, no compliance impact |

### Rollout Strategies

<Steps>
  <Step title="Test Group">
    Deploy to pilot devices first.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitor Mode">
    Watch for issues without enforcing.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Gradual Rollout">
    Expand to more groups over time.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Full Enforcement">
    Enable enforcement organization-wide.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Compliance Monitoring

### Compliance Dashboard

View compliance status:

- Overall compliance percentage
- Non-compliant devices
- Policy-specific compliance
- Trend over time

### Compliance States

| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **Compliant** | Meets all policy requirements |
| **Non-Compliant** | Fails one or more requirements |
| **Pending** | Policy being applied |
| **Error** | Failed to evaluate |
| **Not Applicable** | Policy doesn't apply |

### Non-Compliance Details

For non-compliant devices:

- Which settings failed
- Current vs. required value
- Remediation guidance
- Time since non-compliance

## Remediation

### Auto-Remediation

Some settings can auto-remediate:

| Setting | Auto-Remediation |
|---------|-----------------|
| Firewall enabled | ✅ Can enable |
| Encryption enabled | ⚠️ Requires user action |
| Password policy | ⚠️ Requires password change |
| Software installed | ✅ Can install |
| Software removed | ⚠️ Requires confirmation |

### Manual Remediation

For settings requiring action:

1. Notify device owner
2. Provide remediation steps
3. Set deadline for compliance
4. Follow up on non-compliance

## Policy Templates

### Built-in Templates

Start with pre-built templates:

| Template | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **CIS Benchmark** | Industry-standard baselines |
| **SOC 2 Baseline** | SOC 2 compliance settings |
| **HIPAA Baseline** | Healthcare requirements |
| **Remote Worker** | Settings for remote devices |

### Custom Templates

Create reusable templates:

1. Configure policy
2. Click **Save as Template**
3. Name and describe template
4. Use for new policies

## Reporting

### Policy Reports

Generate reports showing:

- Policy compliance summary
- Device-level details
- Trend analysis
- Non-compliance breakdown

### Evidence for Audits

Policy documentation includes:

- Policy configuration
- Assignment history
- Compliance history
- Remediation records

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start with Baselines" icon="shield-check">
    Use industry baselines (CIS, NIST) as starting points. Customize from there.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Test Before Enforcement" icon="flask">
    Always test policies in monitor mode before enforcing.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Communicate Changes" icon="bullhorn">
    Notify users before policy changes that affect their experience.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Document Exceptions" icon="file-alt">
    When devices need exceptions, document the business justification.
