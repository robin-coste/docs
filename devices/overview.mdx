## Why Device Management?

### Endpoint Security Challenges

- **Remote Work** - Devices outside corporate network
- **BYOD** - Personal devices accessing corporate data
- **Patch Management** - Keeping software updated
- **Compliance** - Enforcing security baselines

### Benefits

- Visibility into all endpoints
- Consistent security configurations
- Rapid vulnerability response
- Compliance evidence generation

## Module Components

### Device List

Central inventory of all enrolled devices:

- Device details and specifications
- Compliance status
- Security posture
- Last check-in time

### Policies

MDM policies for security enforcement:

- Configuration profiles
- Security baselines
- Application restrictions
- Feature controls

[Learn more about Policies →](/devices/policies)

### Vulnerabilities

Continuous vulnerability monitoring:

- CVE detection
- Severity scoring
- Remediation guidance
- Patch tracking

</Steps>

## Device Dashboard

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Total Devices** | Enrolled device count |
| **Compliant** | Devices meeting policy |
| **Non-Compliant** | Devices failing policy |
| **Vulnerable** | Devices with vulnerabilities |
| **Offline** | Devices not checking in |

### Quick Actions

- Enroll new device
- Run compliance scan
- Deploy policy update
- Export device report

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start with Visibility" icon="eye">
    Focus on enrollment first. You can't secure what you can't see.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Policy Gradually" icon="stairs">
    Roll out policies in stages. Start with monitoring, then enforcement.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Prioritize Vulnerabilities" icon="sort">
    Focus on critical and exploited vulnerabilities first.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Regular Check-ins" icon="sync">
    Ensure devices check in regularly. Stale data indicates problems.
