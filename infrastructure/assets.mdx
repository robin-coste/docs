## Overview

The Assets page provides visibility into your organization's external attack surface. Discover domains, subdomains, IP addresses, and web servers.

## Asset Types

### Domains

Your registered domain names:

- Primary domains (yourcompany.com)
- Product domains
- Marketing domains
- Legacy domains

### Subdomains

Discovered subdomains:

- app.yourcompany.com
- api.yourcompany.com
- staging.yourcompany.com
- internal.yourcompany.com

### IP Addresses

Associated IP addresses:

- Web servers
- API endpoints
- Mail servers
- DNS servers

### Web Servers

Running web services:

- Technologies detected
- Ports open
- Certificates
- Screenshots

## Adding Domains

### Manual Addition

1. Navigate to **Infrastructure** → **Assets**
2. Click **Add Domain**
3. Enter domain name
4. Verify ownership (DNS or file)
5. Confirm addition

### Domain Verification

Prove domain ownership:

**DNS Verification:**
```
Add TXT record: bastion-verify=abc123xyz
```

**File Verification:**
```
Create file: /.well-known/bastion-verify.txt
Content: abc123xyz
```

## Discovery

### How Discovery Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="DNS Enumeration">
    Query DNS records for subdomains.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Certificate Transparency">
    Search CT logs for issued certificates.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Web Crawling">
    Follow links to discover related assets.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Port Scanning">
    Check for open ports and services.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fingerprinting">
    Identify technologies and versions.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Discovery Methods

| Method | What It Finds |
|--------|---------------|
| **DNS Records** | A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, TXT |
| **CT Logs** | All issued SSL certificates |
| **Brute Force** | Common subdomain names |
| **Historical Data** | Previously seen subdomains |
| **Web Scraping** | Links in web pages |

### Running Discovery

1. Select domain
2. Click **Run Discovery**
3. Choose depth (quick/standard/deep)
4. Wait for completion
5. Review new findings

## Technology Detection

### Detected Technologies

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Web Server** | nginx, Apache, IIS |
| **Framework** | React, Angular, Django |
| **CMS** | WordPress, Drupal |
| **CDN** | Cloudflare, Akamai |
| **Analytics** | Google Analytics |
| **Security** | WAF, CAPTCHA |

### Why It Matters

Technology detection helps:

- Identify vulnerable versions
- Understand attack surface
- Prioritize patching
- Plan penetration tests

## Asset Classification

### Status Labels

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Active** | Currently in use |
| **Inactive** | Not responding |
| **Unknown** | Needs investigation |
| **Excluded** | Intentionally ignored |

### Classification

Categorize assets:

- Production
- Development
- Staging
- Legacy
- Third-party

### Ownership

Assign owners to assets:

1. Select asset
2. Click **Assign Owner**
3. Select user/team
4. Save

## Excluding Assets

### When to Exclude

Exclude assets that are:

- Not owned by your organization
- Intentionally public
- Known and accepted risks

### Creating Exclusions

1. Select asset
2. Click **Exclude**
3. Provide justification
4. Set expiration (optional)
5. Confirm

## Monitoring

### Change Detection

Monitor for changes:

- New subdomains discovered
- IP address changes
- Technology changes
- Certificate expiration
- New open ports

### Alerts

Configure alerts for:

| Alert Type | Trigger |
|------------|---------|
| **New Asset** | New subdomain discovered |
| **High Risk** | Critical vulnerability found |
| **Change** | Configuration changed |
| **Certificate** | SSL expiring soon |

## Reporting

### Asset Reports

Generate reports:

- Full asset inventory
- New assets this period
- Asset changes
- Risk summary

### Export Formats

- PDF report
- Excel spreadsheet
- CSV data
- JSON export

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Regular Discovery" icon="sync">
    Run discovery regularly. New assets appear as your organization grows.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Verify Unknown Assets" icon="question">
    Investigate unknown assets. They may be shadow IT or attacker infrastructure.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Assign Ownership" icon="user">
    Every asset should have an owner responsible for its security.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Remove Unused Assets" icon="trash">
    Decommission unused assets. Forgotten systems are easy targets.
