## Attack Surface Management

### What is Attack Surface?

Your attack surface includes everything visible to attackers:

- Domains and subdomains
- IP addresses
- Web servers and services
- APIs and endpoints
- Cloud assets

### Why Monitor?

- Discover forgotten assets
- Identify misconfigurations
- Track exposure over time
- Prioritize remediation

## Module Components

### Assets

Manage your digital asset inventory:

- Domains and subdomains
- IP addresses
- Web servers
- Cloud resources

[Learn more about Assets →](/infrastructure/assets)

### Issues

Track security findings:

- Vulnerability discoveries
- Configuration issues
- Exposure risks
- Remediation status

[Learn more about Issues →](/infrastructure/issues)

### Code Security

Software supply chain security:

- SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)
- Dependency vulnerabilities
- Repository monitoring

### Penetration Testing

Manage pentest programs:

- Campaign scheduling
- Pentester portal
- Finding management
- Remediation tracking

### Typosquatting

Domain impersonation detection:

- Similar domain discovery
- Takedown management
- Continuous monitoring

## Getting Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add Domains">
    Add your primary domains for monitoring.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Initial Scan">
    Bastion discovers subdomains and assets.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Assets">
    Verify discovered assets are legitimate.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Address Issues">
    Remediate discovered security issues.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Continuous Monitoring">
    Enable ongoing monitoring for changes.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Dashboard Overview

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Total Assets** | Discovered assets |
| **Open Issues** | Unresolved findings |
| **High/Critical** | Severe issues |
| **Exposure Score** | Overall risk rating |

### Quick Actions

- Add new domain
- Run discovery scan
- View critical issues
- Export reports

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start with Discovery" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Begin by discovering what's out there. You can't protect what you don't know about.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Prioritize Findings" icon="sort">
    Focus on critical and high-severity issues first, especially those exposed to the internet.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Verify Assets" icon="check-circle">
    Review discovered assets. Flag unknown assets for investigation.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Monitor Continuously" icon="sync">
    Attack surface changes constantly. Continuous monitoring catches new exposure.
  </Accordion>
