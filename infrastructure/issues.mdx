## Overview

The Issues page centralizes security findings from your attack surface. Track vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and exposures with a structured remediation workflow.

## Issue Sources

### Discovery Findings

Issues discovered through scanning:

- Open ports exposing services
- Outdated software versions
- Misconfigured servers
- Expired certificates
- Missing security headers

### Penetration Testing

Findings from pentest campaigns:

- Exploitable vulnerabilities
- Business logic flaws
- Authentication issues
- Injection points

### Manual Reports

User-reported issues:

- Bug bounty submissions
- Internal discoveries
- Third-party notifications

## Issue Dashboard

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Total Open** | Unresolved issues |
| **Critical/High** | Severe issues |
| **Aging** | Issues past SLA |
| **Resolved** | Recently fixed |

### Views

| View | Content |
|------|---------|
| **All Issues** | Complete issue list |
| **My Issues** | Assigned to you |
| **Critical** | Highest severity only |
| **Aging** | Past remediation SLA |

## Issue Severity

### Severity Levels

| Level | Description | SLA |
|-------|-------------|-----|
| **Critical** | Immediate exploitation risk | 24 hours |

## Issue Workflow

### Status Flow

```
New → Confirmed → In Progress → Fixed → Verified → Closed
         ↓                        ↓
    Won't Fix               Reopened
```

| **Confirmed** | Verified as valid |
| **In Progress** | Being remediated |
| **Fixed** | Remediation applied |
| **Verified** | Fix confirmed working |
| **Closed** | Issue resolved |
| **Won't Fix** | Accepted risk |
| **Reopened** | Issue returned |

## Managing Issues

### Triaging Issues

When new issue arrives:

1. Review issue details
2. Verify it's valid
3. Assess severity
4. Assign to owner
5. Set target date

### Assigning Issues

1. Open issue
2. Click **Assign**
3. Select owner
4. Add notes
5. Save

### Updating Status

1. Open issue
2. Click **Update Status**
3. Select new status
4. Add comment explaining change
5. Save

## Remediation

### Remediation Guidance

Each issue includes:

- Description of the problem
- Why it matters
- How to fix it
- Verification steps

### Remediation Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Understand">
    Review issue details and impact.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Plan">
    Determine remediation approach.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Implement">
    Apply the fix.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify">
    Confirm the issue is resolved.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Close">
    Mark issue as closed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Verification

Before closing:

1. Re-test the vulnerability
2. Confirm it's not exploitable
3. Document verification method
4. Request independent verification (for high/critical)

## False Positives

### Handling False Positives

When a finding isn't valid:

1. Open issue
2. Click **Mark as False Positive**
3. Provide explanation
4. Add evidence
5. Submit

### False Positive Review

False positives are reviewed:

- Automated checks updated
- Prevent future false positives
- Maintain accuracy

## Risk Acceptance

### When to Accept Risk

Accept risk when:

- Remediation cost exceeds risk
- Compensating controls exist
- Business requires the configuration
- Technical limitations prevent fix

### Accepting Risk

1. Open issue
2. Click **Accept Risk**
3. Provide justification
4. Set review date
5. Get approval (if required)
6. Submit

### Risk Acceptance Review

Accepted risks are reviewed:

- Periodic re-evaluation
- Manager approval
- Documentation for audits

## Reporting

### Issue Reports

Generate reports:

- Open issues summary
- Issues by severity
- Issues by asset
- Aging report
- Trend analysis

### Compliance Evidence

Issue management provides evidence for:

| Framework | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| **SOC 2** | CC7.1, CC7.2 |
| **ISO 27001** | A.12.6.1 |
| **PCI DSS** | 6.1, 11.2 |

## Integration

### ITSM Integration

Create tickets in:

- Jira
- ServiceNow
- Linear

### Alerting

Configure alerts for:

- New critical issues
- SLA breaches
- Status changes
- Issue reopened
