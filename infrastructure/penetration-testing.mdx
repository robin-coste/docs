## Overview

The Penetration Testing module helps you plan, execute, and track penetration testing campaigns. Coordinate with pentesters, manage findings, and track remediation.

## Why Penetration Testing?

### Beyond Automated Scanning

- **Human Intelligence** - Creative attack paths
- **Business Logic** - Application-specific flaws
- **Chained Attacks** - Multi-step exploits
- **Real-World Validation** - Proof of exploitability

### Compliance Requirements

Many frameworks require pentesting:

| Framework | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| **SOC 2** | Periodic testing |
| **PCI DSS** | Annual + after changes |
| **ISO 27001** | Regular testing |
| **HIPAA** | Technical evaluation |

## Campaign Management

### Creating a Campaign

1. Navigate to **Infrastructure** → **Penetration Testing**
2. Click **Create Campaign**
3. Configure:
   - Campaign name
   - Scope definition
   - Start/end dates
   - Pentester assignment
4. Save

### Campaign Types

| Type | Scope | Duration |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Web Application** | Specific application | 1-2 weeks |
| **Network** | Internal/external network | 1-2 weeks |
| **Mobile** | Mobile applications | 1-2 weeks |
| **Cloud** | Cloud infrastructure | 1-2 weeks |
| **Full** | Comprehensive | 3-4 weeks |

### Scope Definition

Define what's in scope:

- Target domains/IPs
- Applications
- Authentication credentials
- Out-of-scope exclusions
- Testing restrictions

## Pentester Portal

### Portal Access

External pentesters access via dedicated portal:

1. Navigate to **Settings** → **Pentester Portal**
2. Click **Invite Pentester**
3. Enter pentester email
4. Assign to campaign
5. Send invitation

### Portal Features

Pentesters can:

- View scope and rules
- Submit findings
- Upload evidence
- Communicate with team

### Portal Permissions

| Permission | Access |
|------------|--------|
| **View** | See campaign details |
| **Submit** | Submit findings |
| **Comment** | Add comments |
| **Upload** | Attach evidence |

## Finding Management

### Submitting Findings

Pentesters submit findings with:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Title** | Brief description |
| **Severity** | Critical, High, Medium, Low |
| **Description** | Full details |
| **Steps to Reproduce** | Exploitation steps |
| **Evidence** | Screenshots, videos, logs |
| **Recommendation** | Remediation guidance |

### Finding Workflow

```
Submitted → Triaged → Confirmed → In Progress → Fixed → Verified → Closed
```

### Finding Review

When findings are submitted:

1. Review for accuracy
2. Assess severity
3. Confirm exploitability
4. Assign to remediation team
5. Track resolution

## Evidence Management

### Evidence Types

- Screenshots
- Video recordings
- Request/response logs
- Exploit code (redacted)
- Tool output

### Evidence Storage

Evidence is:

- Encrypted at rest
- Access controlled
- Retention managed
- Audit logged

## Reporting

### Campaign Report

At campaign completion:

- Executive summary
- Finding summary
- Detailed findings
- Remediation status
- Trend comparison

### Report Formats

| Format | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| **Executive** | Leadership briefing |
| **Technical** | Engineering team |
| **Compliance** | Audit evidence |

## Remediation Tracking

### Tracking Progress

Monitor remediation:

- Open findings by severity
- SLA compliance
- Aging findings
- Remediation velocity

### Retest Coordination

Coordinate retesting:

1. Mark finding as fixed
2. Request retest
3. Pentester validates
4. Confirm or reopen

## Campaign History

### Past Campaigns

View completed campaigns:

- Campaign details
- All findings
- Remediation status
- Reports

### Trend Analysis

Track improvements:

- Finding counts over time
- Severity trends
- Time to remediation
- Recurring issues

## Integration

### Issue Integration

Findings sync with Issues module:

- Automatic issue creation
- Status synchronization
- Unified remediation tracking

### ITSM Integration

Create tickets in:

- Jira
- ServiceNow
- Linear

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Test Regularly" icon="calendar">
    Annual testing is minimum. Quarterly is better. After major changes is essential.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Define Scope Clearly" icon="bullseye">
    Ambiguous scope leads to missed vulnerabilities or wasted time. Be specific.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Communicate Continuously" icon="comments">
    Regular communication with pentesters ensures focus on priorities.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Track Remediation" icon="chart-line">
    Pentests are only valuable if findings are fixed. Track to completion.
