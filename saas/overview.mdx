## The SaaS Security Challenge

### Growth of SaaS

- Average enterprise uses **100+** SaaS applications
- **80%** of employees use non-approved apps
- **SaaS sprawl** increases security and compliance risk

### Risks of Unmanaged SaaS

| Risk | Impact |
|------|--------|
| **Data Leakage** | Sensitive data in unvetted apps |
| **Compliance Violation** | Unreviewed data processing |
| **Access Control** | No centralized identity |
| **Shadow IT** | Unknown security posture |

## Module Components
