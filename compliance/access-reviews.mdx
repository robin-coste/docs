## Overview

Access Reviews help you periodically verify that users have appropriate access to systems and data. Regular access reviews are a key compliance requirement for frameworks like SOC 2, ISO 27001, and HIPAA.

## Why Access Reviews?

Access reviews address common security risks:

- **Privilege Creep** - Users accumulate access over time
- **Orphan Accounts** - Access remains after role changes
- **Excessive Permissions** - More access than needed
- **Compliance Requirements** - Required by most frameworks

## Creating Access Reviews

### Review Campaigns

1. Navigate to **Compliance** → **Access Reviews**
2. Click **Create Review**
3. Configure the review:
   - **Name** - Descriptive campaign name
   - **Scope** - Systems to review
   - **Reviewers** - Who will review (managers, system owners)
   - **Due Date** - Review deadline
   - **Frequency** - One-time or recurring
4. Click **Create**

### Review Scope Options

| Scope Type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **All Users** | Review all user access |
| **By Group** | Review specific compliance groups |
| **By System** | Review access to specific systems |
| **Privileged** | Review only privileged access |
| **New Access** | Review recently granted access |

## Automated Data Collection

### Integration-Based Collection

With connected integrations, Bastion automatically collects:

- **Identity Provider** - User accounts and group memberships
- **Cloud Services** - Application access and roles
- **Code Repositories** - Repository permissions
- **SaaS Applications** - Application entitlements

### Manual Data Entry

For systems without integrations:

1. Open the review
2. Click **Add Access Data**
3. Upload access listing (CSV format)
4. Map columns to access fields

## Conducting Reviews

### Reviewer Experience

Reviewers see a list of user access to evaluate:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **User** | Employee name |
| **System** | Application or system |
| **Access Level** | Permission or role |
| **Last Used** | Recent access activity |
| **Granted Date** | When access was granted |
| **Decision** | Approve or Revoke |

### Review Actions

| Action | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Approve** | Access is appropriate |
| **Revoke** | Access should be removed |
| **Flag** | Needs further investigation |
| **Delegate** | Assign to another reviewer |

### Bulk Actions

For efficiency:
- Select multiple rows
- Apply bulk approve/revoke
- Add comments to bulk actions

## Remediation

### Handling Revocations

When access is revoked:

1. Revocation creates a task
2. Task assigned to system owner or IT
3. Owner removes access in the system
4. Marks task complete in Bastion
5. Verification confirms removal

### Remediation Tracking

Monitor remediation progress:

- **Pending** - Awaiting removal
- **In Progress** - Removal underway
- **Completed** - Access removed
- **Verified** - Removal confirmed

## Review Reports

### Completion Reports

Generate reports showing:

- **Coverage** - Users and systems reviewed
- **Decisions** - Approve vs. revoke breakdown
- **Completion Rate** - Percentage reviewed
- **Reviewer Performance** - Reviews by reviewer

### Audit Evidence

Access review documentation includes:

- Review scope and methodology
- Complete decision records
- Remediation evidence
- Timestamps and reviewer identities

## Recurring Reviews

### Setting Up Recurrence

Schedule automatic review campaigns:

| Frequency | Use Case |
|-----------|----------|
| **Quarterly** | Critical systems, privileged access |
| **Semi-Annual** | Standard systems |
| **Annual** | Low-risk systems |

### Recurrence Configuration

1. Open existing review
2. Click **Schedule Recurrence**
3. Select frequency
4. Set start date for next review
5. Configure notifications

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Review Privileged Access More Often" icon="crown">
    Admin and privileged accounts should be reviewed quarterly or more frequently due to their elevated risk.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Involve the Right Reviewers" icon="users">
    Managers should review their direct reports. System owners should review system-specific access.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Set Realistic Deadlines" icon="calendar">
    Give reviewers enough time to make informed decisions, but not so long that reviews become stale.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Enforce Completion" icon="check-circle">
    Follow up on incomplete reviews. Incomplete reviews don't satisfy compliance requirements.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Compliance Mapping

Access reviews provide evidence for:

| Framework | Requirements |
|-----------|-------------|
| **SOC 2** | CC6.1, CC6.2, CC6.3 |
| **ISO 27001** | A.9.2.5, A.9.2.6 |
| **HIPAA** | §164.308(a)(4) |
| **PCI DSS** | 7.1, 7.2 |
