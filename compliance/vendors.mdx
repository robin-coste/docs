## Overview

The Vendors section helps you track and assess the security posture of your third-party vendors. Vendor risk management is a key compliance requirement across most frameworks.

## Why Vendor Management?

Third-party vendors can introduce significant risk:

- **Data Access** - Vendors may access sensitive data
- **System Integration** - Connected systems create attack surface
- **Compliance Impact** - Vendor failures affect your compliance
- **Supply Chain Risk** - Compromised vendors can impact operations

## Risk Assessment

### Assessing Vendor Risk

Evaluate each vendor on:

| Factor | Considerations |
|--------|---------------|
| **Data Access** | What data does the vendor access? |
| **System Access** | What systems can they reach? |
| **Criticality** | How critical is the service? |
| **Security Posture** | What security certifications do they have? |
| **Contractual Terms** | What protections are in the contract? |

### Risk Levels

| Level | Description | Review Frequency |
|-------|-------------|------------------|
| **Critical** | Access to sensitive data/systems | Quarterly |
| **High** | Significant business impact | Semi-annually |
| **Medium** | Limited access, moderate impact | Annually |
| **Low** | Minimal access and impact | Every 2 years |

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Maintain Complete Inventory" icon="list">
    Document all vendors, not just critical ones. Shadow IT often involves undocumented vendors.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Review Regularly" icon="sync">
    Don't let vendor reviews become stale. Set up reminders and stick to review schedules.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Require Security Terms" icon="file-contract">
    Ensure contracts include security requirements, incident notification, and data protection clauses.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Plan for Exit" icon="door-open">
    Know how to exit vendor relationships cleanly. Data portability and deletion are key concerns.
