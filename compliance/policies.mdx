## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Keep Policies Concise" icon="compress">
    Long, complex policies are less likely to be read and followed. Focus on essential requirements.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Review Regularly" icon="calendar-check">
    Set review cycles (typically annual) and stick to them. Outdated policies create compliance gaps.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use Clear Language" icon="spell-check">
    Avoid jargon and legalese. Policies should be understandable by all employees.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Track Acknowledgments" icon="check-double">
    Ensure all relevant employees acknowledge policies. Follow up on non-responses.
