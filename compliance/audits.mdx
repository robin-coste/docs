## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start Early" icon="clock">
    Begin audit preparation at least 2-3 months before fieldwork. This provides time to address gaps and gather comprehensive evidence.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Maintain Ongoing Readiness" icon="sync">
    Don't treat compliance as a point-in-time activity. Continuously collect evidence and maintain controls throughout the year.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Communicate Proactively" icon="comments">
    Keep your auditor informed of any changes or issues. Surprises during fieldwork create delays and complications.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Document Everything" icon="file-alt">
    When in doubt, document it. Better to have too much evidence than too little.
