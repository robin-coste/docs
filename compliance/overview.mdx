  </Step>
</Steps>

## Compliance Dashboard

The compliance section of the home dashboard shows:

- **Framework Progress** - Completion percentage for each framework
- **Open Issues** - Controls requiring attention
- **Upcoming Audits** - Scheduled audit dates
- **Policy Status** - Policies pending approval or distribution

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start Early" icon="clock">
    Begin compliance preparation 3-6 months before your target audit date. This gives time to address gaps and collect sufficient evidence.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Automate Everything" icon="robot">
    Connect all relevant integrations to maximize automated evidence collection. Manual evidence is more prone to gaps and inconsistencies.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Document Continuously" icon="pen">
    Keep policies and procedures updated as processes change. Point-in-time documentation leads to compliance drift.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Involve Stakeholders" icon="users">
    Compliance is a team effort. Ensure relevant stakeholders are assigned as control owners and policy approvers.
  </Accordion>
