## Framework Structure

Each framework consists of:

### Trust Service Categories (SOC 2 Example)

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Security (CC)** | Common Criteria - the foundation |
| **Availability (A)** | System availability commitments |
| **Processing Integrity (PI)** | Accurate and complete processing |
| **Confidentiality (C)** | Protection of confidential information |
| **Privacy (P)** | Personal information handling |

### Controls

Controls are specific requirements within each category:

- **Control ID** - Unique identifier (e.g., CC6.1)
- **Description** - What the control requires
- **Test Procedure** - How compliance is verified
- **Evidence Required** - Documentation needed
- **Status** - Pass, Fail, In Progress, Not Applicable

## Managing Frameworks

### Adding a Framework

1. Navigate to **Compliance** → **Frameworks**
2. Click **Add Framework**
3. Select from available frameworks
4. Configure scope (which categories/controls apply)
5. Assign control owners

### Framework Dashboard

Each framework shows:

- **Overall Progress** - Percentage of controls passing
- **Category Breakdown** - Progress per trust service category
- **Test Results** - Recent test outcomes
- **Open Issues** - Controls requiring attention

## Working with Controls

### Control Statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Passing** | Control is implemented and verified |
| **Failing** | Control is not implemented or evidence missing |
| **In Progress** | Implementation underway |
| **Not Applicable** | Control does not apply to your scope |
| **Not Started** | Control has not been evaluated |

### Testing Controls

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Control">
    Click on a control to open its detail view.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Requirements">
    Understand what the control requires and the test procedure.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Collect Evidence">
    Upload evidence or verify automated collection.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run Test">
    Execute the test procedure (automated or manual).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Document Results">
    Record the test outcome and any notes.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Automated Testing

Many controls can be automatically tested through integrations:

- **Identity Controls** - User access verified via identity provider
- **Endpoint Controls** - Device compliance via MDM
- **Code Controls** - Dependency scanning via VCS integration
- **Access Controls** - Permission audits via cloud integrations

<Tip>
  Enable integrations to maximize automated testing. Manual testing should be the exception, not the rule.
</Tip>

## Evidence Management

### Evidence Types

- **Screenshots** - Visual proof of configurations
- **Documents** - Policies, procedures, diagrams
- **Exports** - System-generated reports
- **Logs** - Audit trails and activity logs
- **Automated** - Collected directly from integrations

### Uploading Evidence

1. Open the control requiring evidence
2. Click **Add Evidence**
3. Select evidence type and upload file
4. Add description and date
5. Save evidence

### Evidence Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Date Evidence Appropriately">
    Evidence should cover your audit period. Ensure screenshots and exports include visible dates.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Be Specific">
    Label evidence clearly so auditors can understand what it demonstrates without explanation.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Avoid Sensitive Data">
    Redact passwords, API keys, and PII from screenshots and exports.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Control Ownership

### Assigning Owners

Each control can have an assigned owner responsible for:

- Implementing the control
- Collecting evidence
- Responding to auditor questions

### Owner Responsibilities

1. **Monitor** - Track control status regularly
2. **Maintain** - Keep evidence current
3. **Respond** - Address failures promptly
4. **Communicate** - Update compliance team on changes

## Reporting

### Framework Reports

Generate reports showing:

- Control status summary
- Evidence inventory
- Gap analysis
- Remediation plans

### Export Options

- **PDF** - Formatted report for stakeholders
- **Excel** - Data for analysis
- **Auditor Package** - Bundle for external auditors
