## Welcome to Bastion

This guide will walk you through the essential steps to set up your Bastion workspace and start securing your organization.

## Step 1: Access Your Workspace

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign In">
    Navigate to [app.yourbastion.com](https://app.yourbastion.com) and sign in with your credentials. If you don't have an account, contact your administrator or [request a demo](https://yourbastion.com/demo).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Explore the Dashboard">
    The home dashboard provides an overview of your compliance status and active security monitoring. Use the sidebar to navigate between modules.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Set Up Integrations

Integrations are the foundation of Bastion's automation. Connect your existing tools to enable automatic data collection and policy enforcement.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Identity Provider" icon="id-card">
    Connect your identity provider to automatically import and sync employees:
    - **Azure Active Directory** - Microsoft 365 environments
    - **Okta** - Enterprise identity management
    - **Google Workspace** - Google-based organizations

    Navigate to **Integrations** → Select your provider → Follow the OAuth flow.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Cloud Services" icon="cloud">
    Connect cloud services for compliance monitoring:
    - **Microsoft 365** - Email, calendar, and file access auditing
    - **Google Workspace** - Google apps monitoring

    These integrations enable phishing simulations and data leak detection.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Version Control" icon="code-branch">
    Connect your code repositories for code security:
    - **GitHub** - Repository and dependency scanning
    - **GitLab** - Self-hosted and cloud GitLab instances

    Navigate to **Infrastructure** → **Code Security** → Connect VCS.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Step 3: Import Employees

With your identity provider connected, import your employees:

1. Navigate to **Employees** → **People**
2. Click **Import Users**
3. Select your identity integration
4. Review and confirm the import

<Tip>
  Create **Compliance Groups** to organize employees by department, location, or role. Groups make it easy to assign training and manage access reviews.
</Tip>

## Step 4: Choose Your Modules

Bastion is modular - enable only what you need:
